<h1>Demo</h1>
<p>This is an example of how the Olli watch can detect biometric signals that may be suspected of indicating stress. When the iCan Interactive proprietary algorithms suspect stress in a child wearing the Olli watch, an unconfirmed stress episode is recorded and displayed to the parent through a smartphone or personal computer. The parent will then (optionally) label the episode as a confirmed stress episode, false alarm, or unknown (labeling is optional but may increase the accuracy of the iCan Interactive algorithms). Stress episodes can also be viewed in the biometric signal time series plots (Not shown in this demo). After labeling (or without labeling, if the parent chose to assume that all recorded episodes were true positives, which may be desired in cases where children did not clearly show their perception of their stress levels), stress episodes are fed into statistical algorithms to detect the likelyhood of various factors, such as time, weekday, activity type, location, etc., for causing stress in children and help parents prepare schedules for their children accordingly. Detecting stress automatically is beneficial because children with autism are sometimes unable to verbalize their level of stress.</p>
