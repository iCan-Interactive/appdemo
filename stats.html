<h1>Stats</h1>
<p>This page shows an example of how stress episodes detected by the Olli watch can be used to easily discern factors that are likely to cause stress in children. In this example, instances of various categories of factors are ranked by their probability of causing stress as measured by the Olli watch. The numbers shown were fictitiously created but help illustrate the application of the Olli watch.</p>
